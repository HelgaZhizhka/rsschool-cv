      I work as a frontend developer since 2015. Became a web developer at age

      During this time I was engaged in both layout of sites of varying
      complexity, and the development of sites using Vue.js. Constantly learning
      and developing. At the moment I'm studying React. Now I'm also mentoring
      beginner developers. I like to help others learn and share my experiences.
      I want to become a mentor on the RS School Community.
