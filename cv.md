## About me
I work as a frontend developer since 2015. Became a web developer at age 36  I work remotely at the moment with a Russian-speaking development team. During this time I was engaged in both layout of sites of varying complexity, and the development of sites using Vue.js. Constantly learning and developing. At the moment I'm studying React. Now I'm also mentoring beginner developers. I like to help others learn and share my experiences. I want to become a mentor on the RS School Community.

## Code example:
Sum Arrays
_Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. The numbers can be negative or non-integer. If the array does not contain any numbers then you should return 0._

```javascript
function sum (numbers) {
    "use strict"
    let sum = 0
    if (numbers.length) {
      sum = numbers.reduce(function (total, item) {
        return total + item
      }) 
    } 
    return sum
}

console.log(sum([]))
console.log(sum([1,-1,2.3,4]))
```
